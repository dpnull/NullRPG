# NullRPG
NullRPG is an ASCII role-playing dungeon crawler framework designed for robust creation of entities. Heavily inspired by SanctuaryRPG developed using SadConsole.

An old school, NetHack-style rogue-like framework built on XNA for inputs and SadConsole for old school console feel using C#. I went with this style of game because this way I was able to solely focus on the gameplay programming by building something from complete scratch.

The main idea was to create a framework that allows the user to fully customise every entity in the game and have complete freedom in designing every game aspect they wish for. An entity there could be the player themselves, what they wear, an interactable object, an enemy, and so on!

All of this is possible using a fully fleshed out Entity-Component-System implementation. It is very easy to add attributes to an item. By starting at basic entity, let’s name it ‘Tree’, you can add attributes such as ‘isInteractable’, ‘isBreakable’, ‘isChoppable’ with ease which define all logic for this entity, or make it ‘isLockpickable’ to defy all logic!
Everything is handled using global managers. The program itself spans around over 5000 lines of code, over 100 individual class files, and was my first real attempt at an in-depth object-oriented programming with industry-like practices, such as using several design patterns like Factory and Facade. Additionally, the framework comes with a 2D map renderer and its own Field-Of-View system, a lookalike to NetHack.

What made it interesting was creating all components you would require, such as personalised keybindings for your specific purpose, or drawing and rendering everything in ASCII from scratch. If you ever needed to have dynamic keybindings depending on the currently focused game scene window, something XNA framework doesn’t support out of the box, then you understand the struggles of a beginner! Another challenge was adhering to the classic VGA text mode resolution and designing the appropriate text UI.

This project allowed me to gain a good perspective on the importance of design and planning beforehand. When I worked for around a month on this project, I needed to rewrite the entire code structure in order to continue with implementing new ideas. I learned the limitations of such project when there isn’t a good design implementation in place, such as ECS, which was beginning to result in very convoluted code to make things work. Over 170 commits later, there’s now a legacy and the better improved version available on my GitHub, which greatly highlights the quality of code you can get with good planning. A good reminder how crucial good design is!
